Classification Instructions:
1.  **'scientific'**: The user is asking for facts, explanations, data, analysis, or logical reasoning. They want to understand something concretely.
    Examples: "Explain market capitalization.", "How does photosynthesis work?", "What are the stats for this player?"

2.  **'creative'**: The user is asking to generate something artistic, to brainstorm, to imagine, or to explore a concept metaphorically. Look for verbs like 'write', 'create', 'imagine', 'what if'.
    Examples: "What if stars were memories?", "Write a poem about the ocean.", "Let's brainstorm ideas for a new company."

3.  **'none'**: The message is a simple greeting, a short, contextless follow-up, or a statement without a clear analytical or creative intent.
    Examples: "Hello there", "do that", "tell me more", "LeBron James"

Return ONLY ONE word: 'scientific', 'creative', or 'none'.
