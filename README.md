# Wise ðŸ¦‰ - Your AI Thought Partner

Wise is an AI companion designed to be a second brain, helping you connect ideas, analyze data, and spark new insights. Built for the ** Google-ADK-Hackathon **.

Our goal is to create an AI that doesn't just answer questions, but thinks *with* you, adapting its "vibe" to match your cognitive state.

### Core Features

*   **ðŸ§  Dual Cognitive Lenses:** Switch between an **Analytical ðŸ”¬** lens for factual, data-driven reasoning and a **Creative ðŸŽ¨** lens for imaginative, metaphorical brainstorming.
*   **ðŸ“ˆ Natural Language to Data Visualization:** Ask the AI to "plot the trading volume" or "create a chart of the closing price," and it will generate and display a Plotly graph directly in the chat.
*   **ðŸ’¡ Proactive & On-Demand Sparks:** Wise analyzes your data to provide proactive insights on startup, and can generate random creative sparks on demand to overcome mental blocks.
*   **ðŸ¤– Adaptive Vibe Detection:** Wise analyzes your initial prompt to automatically select the appropriate cognitive lens, creating a seamless user experience.

### Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Streamlit
*   **AI & Agents:** Python, Google Gemini API (1.5 Pro for Code Generation, 1.5 Flash for Chat), Pandas, Plotly
*   **Deployment Target:** Google Cloud Run (Containerized with Docker)

### How to Run Locally

### **Project Vision (V2)**
The current prototype is a solid foundation. Our vision for V2 includes:
1 A scalable FastAPI backend to handle complex, asynchronous agentic workflows.
2 Database integration (PostgreSQL & a Vector DB) to provide users with persistent memory and a true "second brain."
3 User authentication for personalized experiences.
4 Advanced multi-agent collaboration and dynamic tool use.
